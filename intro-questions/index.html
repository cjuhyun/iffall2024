        <h1>My introduction!</h1>

        <p>1. My name is Julie Cho and I'm a senior majoring in BA Communication Design and Marketing.</p>

        <p>2. I initially primarily worked on analog art but my interest has gradually transitioned towards digital art. The class is required for my major and I'm looking forward to learning about the CS skills used in web design! </p>

        <p>3. I don't have any prior experience with html/css/js. </p>

        <p>4. I hope I can familiarize myself with the html tags so that I am able to accurately recreate my artistic vision onto a digital platform.  </p>

        <p>5. I think the biggest difference is the time and effort it takes to bring our ideas to life. Designing for paper can be done without having to use other languages as required when designing for screen. 
            Through CS 131, I realized that coding requires a lot of trial and error to ensure that the language we use aligns with our vision of the digital design.</p>

        <p>6. <a>https://www.airbnb.com/</a> Airbnb's website is clean and easy to navigate. I think they are effective in organizing all the categories of services they have to offer appropriately. </p>

        <p>7. <a>https://mooders.net/</a> The website is direct to the point by stating in one sentence what they do and it is easy to navigate what they offer using their menu button.</p>

        <p>8. <a>https://ranlus.fr/</a> I liked how this website structures its content while also being very interactive with the user. Since every movement of my cursor affects the dynamic of the screen, it keeps me engaged and it feels as though my presence on the web is important! </p>
